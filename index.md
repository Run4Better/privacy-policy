This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect user data in our fitness and training analytics application (the “Application”).

## 1. Overview

The Application is an early-stage startup MVP designed to help users analyze and understand their fitness and training data.

We respect user privacy and are committed to protecting personal data. We only collect and process data with explicit user authorization.

## 2. Data Sources

The Application may collect data from third-party fitness platforms (such as Garmin) only after the user explicitly authorizes access via OAuth or similar authorization mechanisms.

## 3. Data Collected

With user consent, the Application may collect the following types of data:

- **Activity data** (e.g., running, cycling, workouts)
- **Wellness data** (e.g., heart rate, sleep, body metrics)
- **Basic account identifiers** required for data synchronization (e.g., a platform user ID)

We do **not** intentionally collect sensitive personal data unrelated to fitness and wellness.

---

## 4. How We Use Data

Collected data is used solely for the following purposes:

- To provide fitness analytics, visualizations, and insights to the user
- To improve product functionality and user experience
- To support core application features (e.g., sync, history, trends)

All data usage is limited to the user who owns the data.

## 5. Data Sharing

We do **not** sell, rent, or trade user data.

We do **not** share user data with third parties for advertising, marketing, or commercial resale purposes.

Data may be disclosed only when required by law or to comply with legal obligations.

Access to user data is restricted to systems and services necessary to operate the Application.

## 7. Data Retention and Deletion

User data is retained only as long as necessary to provide the Application’s services.

Users may request deletion of their data at any time. Upon request, we will permanently delete user data within a reasonable timeframe.

## 8. User Rights

Users have the right to:

- Access their data
- Request correction of inaccurate data
